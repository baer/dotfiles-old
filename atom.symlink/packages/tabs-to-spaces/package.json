It can be executed from:\n\n* Command Palette\n    * `Tabs To Spaces: Tabify`\n    * `Tabs To Spaces: Untabify`\n* Packages Menu\n    * `Packages > Tabs to Spaces > Tabify`\n    * `Packages > Tabs to Spaces > Untabify`\n* Context Menu\n    * `Tabify`\n    * `Untabify`\n\n## Configuration\n\nTabs to Spaces uses the following configuration values:\n\n* `editor.getTabLength()` &mdash; sets the number of space characters a tab character is equivalent to\n* `tabs-to-spaces.onSave` &mdash; if set to either \"tabify\" or \"untabify\" it performs that operation on save\n    * Previously this was named `on-save`, but this conflicts with the humanizing algorithm used for configuration options, so it was changed to follow the standard.\n\n### Keybinding\n\nI have not set keybindings for this package. They can easily be added by referencing the following commands:\n\n* `tabs-to-spaces:tabify`\n* `tabs-to-spaces:untabify`\n\nFor example, to map the Untabify command to <kbd>Cmd+Alt+T</kbd>:\n\n```cson\n'.editor:not(.mini)':\n  'alt-cmd-t': 'tabs-to-spaces:untabify'\n```\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; 2014 by [Lee Dohm](http://www.lee-dohm.com).
