# Tabs to Spaces

An Atom package for converting between leading tabs and leading spaces.

## Installation

The package can be installed by using the Settings screen and searching for `tabs-to-spaces`.

It can also be installed from the command line with the command:

```bash
apm install tabs-to-spaces
```

## Use

It can convert between leading tabs and spaces in the current editor window. Any combination of leading whitespace is converted to all spaces (Untabify) or the maximum number of tabs and minimum number of spaces with tabs up front (Tabify) to fill the same space. It can be executed from:

* Command Palette
    * `Tabs To Spaces: Tabify`
    * `Tabs To Spaces: Untabify`
* Packages Menu
    * `Packages > Tabs to Spaces > Tabify`
    * `Packages > Tabs to Spaces > Untabify`
* Context Menu
    * `Tabify`
    * `Untabify`

## Configuration

Tabs to Spaces uses the following configuration values:

* `editor.tabLength` &mdash; sets the number of space characters a tab character is equivalent to
* `tabs-to-spaces.onSave` &mdash; if set to either `tabify` or `untabify` it performs that operation on save

### Keybinding

I have not set keybindings for this package. They can easily be added by referencing the following commands:

* `tabs-to-spaces:tabify`
* `tabs-to-spaces:untabify`

For example, to map the Untabify command to <kbd>Cmd+Alt+T</kbd>:

```cson
'.editor:not(.mini)':
  'alt-cmd-t': 'tabs-to-spaces:untabify'
```
